          "Drop yourself off the Hősök tere metro station. it means you ride the second oldest metro line of the world (or so, the oldest in continental Europe). You are on a square where the central monument of statues were all erected to celebrate the 1000th anniversary of the Hungarians’ presence in the Carpathian basin in 1896. Walk around the park behind, to see the largest outdoor ice-skating rink of Europe – or a cute boating pond if you come in the summer time. Head up to the castle Vajdahunyad right next to the lake: you are now in a tiny world of a fairy tale illusion. Also built in 1896 as a pavilion for the Millennial Expo, it was supposed to be a temporary wooden building, and later became a permanent one. Today it hosts the Museum of Agriculture. In the back of the yard, right in front of the entrance of the museum, you may wonder what a dementor is doing there. No worries, it’s just a chronicler form the 12th century who recorded the origin legends of the Hungarians. He’s called Anonymous as didn’t want to be known by his name, but by his book. Anyway, just touch his feather, so you may have inspiration for writing too. Next to the castle, on the opposite side of the park, you may wonder what that huge yellow building could be! Well, it’s the biggest thermal bath of Budapest (yes, we have some) and the only one on the Pest-side. If you are not willing to enjoy the 15 indoor and 3 outdoor pools, just skip into the side entrance close to the metro station called “Széchenyi fürdő”), and have a look out of the entrance hall’s windows and admire how people enjoy the amazing atmosphere of its yard. Then ride back to the metro and head till the station of Opera.Yes, you are there at this small, but the gorgeous palace of music. You shouldn’t love classical music to fall in love with its amazing neo-renaissance milieu. Daily guided tours are provided in several languages, ending with a short opera-song play in its wonderful staircase. Now walk at the beginning of the Andrássy Avenue where the city’s heart is beating. Andrássy Avenue was born in 1870, as the axe for the citizens to access the edge of the city – what back in those years was where you saw Heroes Square. The palaces are the remaining memories of the aristocracy. When you arrived at the corner of Andrássy Avenue, you will see a huge dome on your right. This is the Saint Stephen Basilica. Stephen (István, for the Hungarians) was the first king of the country who also converted the nation to the Roman Catholic religion. Creepy or not, but his right hand is in a cabinet in its chapel. If you don’t have vertigo, you can also climb up to its dome and admire the city from 365°. Within the dome of the Parliament, it is the tallest building of Budapest. Now just walk out to the river and enjoy the wonderful panorama what is so unique that it deserved to be a UNESCO World Heritage site! Now just let the city to enchant you",

You should start your trip at Szentháromság tér (Trinity square), right next to the Matthias church. This is the peak of the whole hill. This district is also protected by the UNESCO World Heritage. Now as you are standing in the middle of the Castle hill, you should know that, though it changed a lot since the first royal palace was built up here, it has served as the capital city since the 13 century. The church next to you is also dated back to the 13 century, but the shape you see now was born in the 1880s due to an extension of its original size.  In the past it was an important church for a few kings who were crowned here. To make the church even more beautiful, at the same time when it was extended, they erected a panorama terrace called Fisherman’s Bastion. Back in the middle ages, the section of the city rampart used to run here, was protected by the Fishermen’s Guild. Right between the church and bastion you could see a very unusual Saint Stephen statue representing him as an equestrian.From here you could decide to walk to the Northern or Southern edge of the hill. If you continue northward, you could catch the ruins and remaining medieval tower of Maria Magdalena church. If you want, you can walk up on its top and enjoy the fantastic panorama over the castle. On the square where the church stands, you could visit the Museum of Arms. If you walk to the South from Matthias church, you will arrive to the Royal Palace. Of course it doesn’t host any king now, and it’s not the original medieval palace but you could visit the Museum Of Budapest, the National Gallery of Hungary or the National Library of Hungary currently hosted in the building-complex.Behind the Royal Palace, you could wonder the green hills of Buda and its closes neighbor, Gellért hill.",
